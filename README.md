# D.E.T

D.E.T (Decide, Evaluate, Terminate) is a software program designed to analyze data and make decisions about an individual's survival based on specific criteria. Through in-depth analysis of medical, biological and social information, the software helps to determine whether a person should continue to live or not, according to a set of pre-defined parameters.

Main objectives:
Decide: Based on the criteria entered into the system, the software makes decisions about an individual's survival. This includes health factors and general considerations.
Evaluate: The software analyzes detailed information on each individual to assess their medical situation and their risk of survival or contribution within a specific setting.
Terminate: If conditions are deemed unfavorable according to the defined parameters, the software concludes on the need to terminate the person's existence, based on the criteria assessed.

Main features:
Personal data evaluation: The software collects information on the individual's genetics, medical history and current state of health. This data is used to create a complete profile, which is then analyzed according to decision criteria.

Risk analysis: The software assesses the risks associated with each individual's state of health, and takes into account factors such as severity of illness, chances of recovery, or other relevant criteria to determine survival.

Decision-making: Based on the analysis of the data, the system generates a recommendation as to whether the person should continue to live, according to the medical and social criteria previously defined.

User interface: A simple interface allows the user to enter the necessary data for each individual and run the analysis. The result of the assessment is then displayed in the form of a clear recommendation.

Results management: After a complete assessment, the software displays the results in the form of recommendations. These results are used to make decisions in contexts where the management of human and medical resources is crucial.

Technologies used :
Database : The software relies on a database to store and organize the information needed to evaluate individuals.
Python: Software development is based on the Python language, used for data management, analysis calculations and results display.
Advanced calculations: Use of algorithms to process data and provide precise recommendations based on input parameters.
Software use:
D.E.T is designed to be used by healthcare professionals, crisis managers or any other organization requiring a fast, efficient decision-making tool. Thanks to its ability to process large quantities of data, the software offers a solution for managing situations where human and medical resources are limited and decisions need to be made quickly.

Conclusion:
D.E.T is a powerful piece of software that enables important decisions to be made based on the evaluation of an individual's data. It is designed to operate in contexts where survival decisions are required, based on medical and social criteria. This software is a tool to help professionals make informed decisions and manage complex situations effectively.
